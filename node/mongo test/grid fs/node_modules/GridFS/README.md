# GridFS

Simple yet powerful GridFS capabilities built on [node-mongodb-native](https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native "node-mongodb-native").

## Installation:

Install using npm:
<pre>
npm install GridFS
</pre>

Then include GridFS in your projects:
<pre>
var GridFS = require('GridFS').GridFS;
var GridStream = require('GridFS').GridStream;
</pre>

## Tests:

To run the tests:
<pre>
make tests
</pre>

## Examples:

A simple Hello World example using GridFS.
<pre>
var GridFS = require('GridFS').GridFS;

// Use the test database
var myFS = new GridFS('test');
var text = new Buffer('Hello World!');

// Functions are performed in the order they are queued
myFS.put(text, 'Hello World!', 'w', function(err){
	if(err) console.log(err);
});

myFS.get('Hello World!',function(err,data){
	console.log(data);
});

// Functions called on a GridFS object after it has closed will be queued to perform
// when it opens again.
myFS.close();
</pre>

A similar example using GridStream.
<pre>
var GridStream = require('GridFS').GridStream;

// Use the test database and open or create 'Hello World!'
var writeStream = GridStream.createGridWriteStream('test','Hello World!','w');

writeStream.write('Hello World!');
writeStream.end();
</pre>
